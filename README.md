# E-government
With the recent advances in AI and deep learning technologies, more government agencies are starting to use such technologies to improve their systems and services. However, a large set of challenges hinder the adoption of such technologies, including the lack of experts, computational resources, trust, and AI interpretability. we introduced the definitions of artificial intelligence and e-government, briefly discussed the current state of e-government indices around the world, and then proposed our solutions to advance the current state of egovernment, considering the Gulf Countries as a case study. We proposed a framework for management of government information resources that help manage the e-government lifecycle end-to-end. Then, we proposed a set of deep learning techniques that can help facilitate and automate several e-government services. After that, we proposed a smart platform for AI development and implementation in e-government.  
The overarching goal of this paper is to introduce new frameworks and platform to integrate recent advances in AI techniques in the e-government systems and services to improve the overall trust, transparency, and efficiency of e-government.
